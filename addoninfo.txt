	addonDescription	"Realism, Hard Twelve, Death's Door, temp health only, slow temp health decay, doubled Tank health, all maps can have up to 4 Witches and 2 Tanks, 50% more damage from Commons in Expert, no first aid kits at all but adrenaline is normal, and the safe room heals a free pills so no reason to suicide.

The internal mode name for use in the console is hellonearth.

I want to say right away that this is a new mutation for those who like and are always looking to challenge themselves in the game. It was thought and made in a way to possibly be very difficult but at the same time playable and fun. So much so that it's proposed to be exclusively played on Expert difficulty.

Feel challenged. Record your runs. I really hope you have as much fun as the amount of restarts.
